My Kometa (Plex Meta Manager) config
====================================

This project is focused on providing a minimalistic, refined design for displaying media collections, with an emphasis on visual clarity and an intuitive user experience. It integrates critic and audience ratings as overlays on media items, making it easy to compare public opinion and professional reviews. The rating overlays are combined to avoid clutter, creating a clean visual style while still providing valuable information at a glance.

Installation
------------

There are two main ways to install Kometa:

*   Running as a Python script on your system (referred to as a "local" install)
*   Running as a Docker container

**Recommendation:** Running as a Docker container is simpler because you donâ€™t need to worry about installing Python or its dependencies. For most users, Docker is the preferred method unless you have a specific reason to avoid it.

### Step 1: Clone the Repositories

Before proceeding with the installation, you need to clone the Kometa repository and your custom configuration repository:

1.  Clone the main Kometa repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa.git

3.  Navigate to the Kometa folder:

    $ cd Kometa

5.  Clone your custom configuration repository into the `/config` folder:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sperea/my_kometa_plex_meta_manager_config.git config

This will ensure that the necessary configuration files are placed directly in the `/config` folder, which Kometa requires for proper setup.

### Docker Installation

Once the repositories are cloned, if you choose to install using Docker, follow these steps:

    $ docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/config:/config:rw" kometateam/kometa

This command mounts the `config` folder containing your custom configurations. Adjust the path if needed.

### Local Installation

For those who prefer a local installation, Kometa requires Python 3.8 to 3.11. Follow these steps:

1.  Install the required dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter errors, try:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed

5.  Run Kometa to verify the installation:

    $ python kometa.py

### Docker Compose

If you prefer to use Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

    
    services:
      kometa:
        image: kometateam/kometa
        container_name: kometa
        volumes:
          - ./config:/config
        environment:
          - TZ=Europe/Berlin
        restart: unless-stopped
        

Adjust the path to `./config` as needed. Save the file and run:

    $ docker-compose up -d

Repository Location
-------------------

To ensure proper configuration and functionality, the contents of this repository should be placed inside the `/config` folder of Kometa. This is necessary because Kometa looks for all configuration files, such as `config.yml`, collections, and overlays, within this directory.

For Docker users, mount the repository as the `/config` directory by using the following command:

    $ docker run -it -v "path/to/this/repository:/config:rw" kometateam/kometa

Make sure to replace `path/to/this/repository` with the actual path to the folder where you cloned this repository. This way, all configuration files will be properly detected by Kometa during execution.

If you are using Docker Compose, modify the volume section to match your repository path:

    
    services:
      kometa:
        image: kometateam/kometa
        container_name: kometa
        volumes:
          - /path/to/this/repository:/config
        restart: unless-stopped
        

Once you have verified that the files are correctly placed in the `/config` folder, Kometa will be able to access and apply all the settings, overlays, and collections from this repository.
